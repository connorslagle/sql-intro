## Outline

* Creating and populating a DB
* Query primer
* Filtering
* Querying multiple tables
* Working with sets
* Grouping and Aggregates


The purpose of this sprint to the gain familiarity with SQL fundementals, including joins and working with sets. This will prepare you for the web indexing exercise in the Wikipedia NLP sprint to follow.

First off, read through [SQL for Data Scientists](http://bensresearch.com/downloads/SQL.pdf) document and become familiar with basic SQL commands, inner and outer joins, and basic grouping and aggregation functions.

We will be using [Postgres SQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) in this exercise. Postgres SQL is often used in industry for its useful extensions such as [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/).



Go [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) for a tutorial on Postgres. This will give you a basic overview of syntax and other things that you encountered in the lecture.
